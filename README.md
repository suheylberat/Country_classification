# Country_classification
This repo uses the recurrent neural network structure in pytoch to predict the country to which cities and towns belong. This project is my first train project and I got to know the rnn structure with this project. I got the codes from Patrick Loeber's video and I learnt the retraining structure using gpts such as Chatgpt and Claude. I copied the codes from the video, because it is my first project and experience, but I am also uploading the first file I wrote the codes to show how much effort I made while understanding it and to show how willing I am to understand it, called rnnexample. You can see many explanations in Turkish and English. 
I got the data from chatgpt so there may be inaccuracies. I would be grateful if you warn me.

I hope it was a good project. Thank you for reading.
